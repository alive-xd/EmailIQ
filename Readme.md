## 🧠 What is AI Email Intelligence Platform?

This project was built with a clear goal:

To simulate a real-world CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service) email control panel like SendGrid or Twilio.

Instead of building only infrastructure, this focuses on the **control plane** — the dashboard teams actually use to:

- manage campaigns  
- monitor delivery  
- analyze logs  
- generate content  
- get AI insights  

It demonstrates full-stack engineering + AI integration in a practical product.
